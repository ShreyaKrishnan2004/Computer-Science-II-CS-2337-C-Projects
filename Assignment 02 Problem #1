/*When numbering highways, highways with values greater than 100 are considered auxiliary highways while highways with values less than
100 are considered primary highways. Highways with highway numbers that are odd run from north to south, and highways with highway numbers
that are even run from east to west. This program asks the user for a highway number and determines whether that highway is a valid highway
number (highways are not allowed to end in 00) and whether the highways are primary or auxiliary and run from north to south or from east
to west.*/
